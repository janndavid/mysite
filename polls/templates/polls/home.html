      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>My name is Jann Jacobsen, as previously stated, I am currently
        a soon to be bachelor of Computer Science. However, previous to my
        current studies, I studied Software Engineering at the University
        of Southern Denmark, SDU if you will. This means that not only am I
        equipped to solve problems as in Computer Science, but also able to
        document, structure and code a project properly. I am, however, more
        interested in game development, as I love to dwelve into a good story
        and putting that story to life by a game generally intrigues me. </p>
